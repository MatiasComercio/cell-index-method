				Each point has an x & y component.
				To get at which cell of the matrix the point belongs, here it is the idea of what's done.
				Consider the case of a column:
				* check which is the number t that makes t*k <= point.x() < (t+1)*k
				* if t is an integer, the column taken is t-1 (unless t = 0), as it would be the case that the point is
						at a cell boundary, and it can be classified in any of those.
				* if t is not an integer, the floor of t is taken as the column number
				
				The same goes for the row.
				
				Notes:
					* For translating points to the correct matrix index, the following formula is used:
							column = ( nCells - 1 ) - t
							
							The problem is "drawn" following, with nCell = 5 for this example
							
								(x,y) plain with t
								indexes as they are got
							
							y
							|
							4
							3
							2
							1
							0 1 2 3 4 --> x
							
								matrix with
								translated t indexes
							0 1 2 3 4
							1
							2
							3
							4
							
							Notice that the second form is the one needed to work with the matrix,
							so as to be able to make a more efficient process
							
					* rows are calculated with point.y() and cols with point.x()
					(see previous graphics for a better understanding).
